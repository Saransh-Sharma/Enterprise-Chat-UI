## Why this? üí°

Because the official Chat ___lacks important features___, is ___more limited than the api___, at times
___slow or unavailable___, and you cannot deploy it yourself, remix it, add features, or share it with
your friends.
Our users report that ___big-AGI is faster___, ___more reliable___, and ___features rich___
with features that matter to them.

```bash

```bash
docker build -t big-agi .
